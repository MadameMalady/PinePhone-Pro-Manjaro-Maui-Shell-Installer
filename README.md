# PinePhone-Pro-Manjaro-Maui-Shell-Installer.
# MMSI

This is a script to help Pinephone Pro owners running Manjaro (tested with Phosh) install the convergent shell for desktops, tablets, and phones; Maui-Shell on their Pinephone Pro.


I do not know if git-clone will work to download, if it doesn't, download the .sh from the 'releases' page instead.
